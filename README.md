# Exchange [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/artsy/exchange.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/artsy/exchange)  [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/artsy/exchange/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/artsy/exchange)
Exchange aspires to be responsible for the various types of e-commerce interactions available on the Artsy platform. It's currently a prototype, with legacy e-commerce still handled by Gravity. It uses Ruby, Rails, Postgresql, and exposes a [GraphQL](http://graphql-ruby.org/) API.

## Setup

* Fork the project to your GitHub account

* Clone your fork:
  ```
  $ git clone git@github.com:your-github-username/exchange.git
  ```

* Install bundles:
  ```
  $ bundle install
  ```

## Tests

Once setup, you can run the tests like this:

```
$ bundle exec rspec
```

## Starting Server
If this is your first time starting the app, make sure your database is setup first by running:
```shell
rails db:create
rails db:setup
```

Then run Procfile.dev via foreman to start the web (rails) and worker (sidekiq)
services:

```bash
foreman start -f Procfile.dev
```

## Did You Change Models?

### [Papertrail Audit Logging](./docs/papertrail_audit_logging.md)

We use the [PaperTrail gem](https://github.com/paper-trail-gem/paper_trail) to maintain a log of data changes to important models within the main relational database.

### Analytics Notification
If you changed something in the `/models` make sure to inform #data (analytics) team about it in case it impacts their reports.

## Running Prettier Ruby

Exchange uses [Prettier Ruby](https://github.com/prettier/plugin-ruby) to standarize coding styles:

```sh
bundle exec rake prettier
```

## Did You Change GraphQL Schema?
Metaphysics is the current consumer of Exchange GraphQL schema and keeps a copy of latest schema in https://github.com/artsy/metaphysics/tree/master/src/data, if you have changed Exchange GraphQL schema, make sure you also update the copy of this schema in Metaphysics. In order to do so follow these steps:
1) In exchange run
```shell
rake graphql:schema:idl
```
2) rename `schema.graphql` file generated ‚òùüèº to `exchange.graphql`
```shell
mv schema.graphql exchange.graphql
```
3) copy file above to your local update Metaphysics under `src/data` and make a PR to Metaphysics with this change. 

There is a guide on how to add exchange operations to Metaphysics [here](https://github.com/artsy/metaphysics/blob/master/docs/create_exchange_operations.md)


## Talking to Exchange ü§ë

In order to talk to Exchange GraphQL endpoint:

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- Update the `REPLACE` values in the `.env` file. You can reference the values used on staging with `hokusai staging env get` or use [copy_env][] to automate the task.
- Install `dotenv` by `gem install dotenv`
- Start local server `dotenv rails s`
- If you work at Artsy, get proper Gravity User Token following [these instructions](https://github.com/artsy/gravity/blob/master/doc/ApiAuthentication.md#fetching-a-user-jwt-for-the-target-service) (the client application name is "Exchange Staging").
- Install and run [GraphiQL](https://github.com/skevy/graphiql-app) app `brew cask install graphiql`
- In GraphiQL app, go to http://localhost:3000/api/graphql, you should ge unauthorized error
- Edit HTTP Headers and add `Authorization` header and set it to `Bearer <token>` where `<token>` is your Gravity token generated few steps above.

### Working at Artsy?

#### GraphQL Queries
We share our GraphQL sample queries using [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) shared workspace. You can import latest queries from [environments_and_requests.json](https://github.com/artsy/potential/tree/master/insomnia)

#### Get Access To Exchange
Access to Exchange Admin is limited to users with the role "Sales Admin". Ask someone with Role Manager permissions to grant your user "Sales Admin" permissions.

### Debugging
Something went wrong? Ideally in the JSON response returned from Exchange there will be enough info to describe what went wrong. In case that was not useful, you can:

1) Check [Sentry](https://sentry.io) (password in 1Pass) and look for Exchange (staging or production) and see the error.
2) Follow exchange logs by doing
```shell
hokusai staging logs -f
```

If you think there is something we could improve in this error case, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/artsy/exchange/issues/new) with details about what you did and what went wrong.
